MSF-CVHR: Multi-Scale Fusion with Cross-View Head Re-Identification for Crowd Counting

Overview

Crowd counting in complex scenarios remains challenging due to severe occlusion, perspective distortion, and redundant counting across multiple camera views.
To address these issues, MSF-CVHR introduces a novel crowd counting network that integrates:

Hybrid Attention Module for precise spatial and channel feature extraction.

Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Module for fine-grained and contextual representation.

Cross-View Head Re-Identification Module that leverages both appearance and geometric similarity to reduce redundant counting across views.

This design enables robust crowd counting in both single-view and multi-view settings
